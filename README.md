For this project I will be investigating Heart Rate Variable (HRV)

According to research the higher the variability in heart rate the better health a person should be in. In this project we will be looking a variables that can effect a persons HRV and using the numpy.random package to model this data. The variables include lifestyle factors, biological factors and exercise.
